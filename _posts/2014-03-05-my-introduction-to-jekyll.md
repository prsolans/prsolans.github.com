It's not a suprise that someone with a new Jekyll-based GitHub Page talks about it, in fact it's probably obligatory. 

I will add this one tidbit, if not useful, then at least hopefully a bit comforting.

Once I started down this path, I realized that there is more than one static site generator out there. And while I was midway through the initial setup, I decided to take a look and see if I was - if nothing else - at lease barking up a popular tree.

It turns out that Jekyll does compare favorably on a couple key metrics: community and recent activity.

According to http://staticsitegenerators.net/, Jekyll is the most-starred item listed, has existed for 5 years, and the latest contribution to the source on Github happened yesterday. So... we shall continue!
