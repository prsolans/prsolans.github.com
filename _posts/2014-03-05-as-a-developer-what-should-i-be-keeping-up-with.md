If I've learned one thing, it's that expertise is relative. Development experience is varied, projects are distinct, and I frequently find myself at both ends of the knowledge spectrum.

Nobody likes to be the uncomfortable when they start up a new project, and so many motivated developers devote energy to learning about languages and techniques, frameworks and libraries, servers and software.

### A certain set of skills

The goal of all this study is to select things that help you be productive for a long time. My skillset is originally built around PHP and MySql, but has expanded to include content mangement systems, front-end tools and techniques, server configuration, and most recently development operations tools. 

Currently, I am studying the following topics:

+ __Puppet/Chef__ - I have been using Vagrant for about a year, and am striving to help me colleagues quickly and easily build consistent development environments. I started with Chef, but have been having more success with Puppet as of late.
+ __Responsive Development__ - I've worked with Bootstrap and Foundation (among others), and have opinions on the strengths and weaknesses of each. I would still say I am seeking a best-of-breed solution.
+ __HTML5 Chart Development__ - Experimented with chart.js, ammaps and other libraries for presented animated and interesting data across many devices.

All three of these topics help demonstrate the difficulties in this profession. They all present multiple options, all of which are advancing at a rapid pace. Keeping up is a challenge, keeping sharp is a worse, and actually getting ahead may not be possible at all.

### Giving back

I have a big-picture view of development. My knowledge has been gained through countless Google searches and the efforts of my peers to learn, document and share their insights. 

I have gained a lot from the community, and recognize the need to give back. So in addition to learning, I am going to attempt to give back. I believe one of the best changes I've made in the past couple years is to improve my documentation skills. Like any other skill, documentation benefits from regular practice, and I hope that while I hone my abilities, the information I put down can help others make more deadlines and break less budgets.
